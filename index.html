                <p class="libre-baskerville-regular">Sundae Theory is a thinking and writing collective that first coalesced at The Evergreen State College in 2015. We named ourselves after the anthology of French-Canadian poststructuralist feminist writers, Theory, A Sunday, whose practices and tenets of togetherness we hold dear. Much of our time together is spent taking care of each other, which we feel is no small feat. We playfully engage with what it might mean to “make nothing happen,” a phrase from Auden that speaks to us because it offers a space to reimagine value. We currently live in four different U.S. cities, and in recent years, we’ve focused our efforts on creating new forms and venues for collective writing, such as Sundae School, our annual art and writing retreat.</p>
